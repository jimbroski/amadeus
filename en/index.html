  **Jesus commanded His followers to preach to people and testify that Jesus Christ is appointed by God to be the judge of the living and the dead. Every person has only one life on this earth. Then they will face Godâ€™s judgment at the end of times.**

  There is heaven and hell. One will receive either eternal life in heaven or be condemned eternally in hell. Anyone who has sinned, and there is no one who has not incurred guilt on himself, will be condemned. These are bad news for all people. How can anyone be saved from this?

  **God Himself has provided a way out. Jesus Christ is the Savior. This is the Gospel, the Good News of Jesus Christ. Jesus has been spoken of from ages old. All the prophets testify that everyone who believes in Jesus receives forgiveness of sins through His name.**

  No one has to perish. No one is condemned to end up in hell. God loves people. God showed this great love of His when He sent His only Son to be the Savior of the world. Whoever will believe in Jesus Christ will not be condemned but will have eternal life. Because God did not send His Son in the world to condemn it, but in order that the world might be saved through Him.

  **Jesus Christ is the Way, the Truth, and the Life.**
